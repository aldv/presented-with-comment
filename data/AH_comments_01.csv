They probably put it on Let's Play because of length, but it's absolutely *not* a Let's Play- not only is there no actual *playing* of the game, but there's also no context (someone who has no background in ""Fallout Shelter"" would have no clue what's going on and couldn't care less). If anything, I think they should have put it on the main RT channel and called it ""Let's Open 50 Packs in Fallout Shelter"" or something along those lines.

Let me put it to you this way.  Lets say you were playing Minecraft and to make a Diamond pickaxe took one diamond but to make a diamond helmet took twenty and a diamond chest piece took forty diamonds.  The higher in the tech tree you climb the more artificial resource scarcity is introduced, there are gateway materials for things like oil and Chitin but otherwise it's not rarity that holds you back but rather amounts.

Equipment in Ark at default levels is balanced so in order to get enough hide to make say a saddle to ride a Raptor need need to kill an average of eight other raptors to get the 110 hide you need to get to make one saddle.

A high end saddle like a Megaldon saddle requires 290 hide... or about six dead Brontosauruses, yes there's not enough hide on one dinosaur the side of three story building to build a saddle good enough to let you ride a thirty foot shark.   Bronto saddles take ""only"" 350 hide (seven dead brontosauruses) and 40 metal.

Which is why most servers has the resource/xp scales at three or four times what the dev's set as default.  The best example is taming time which can take upwards of four real hours depending on what materials you use to tame them.  With the right materials it's ""only"" an hour.

"Achievement Hunter","AH checks out Echo Of Soul",reddit,s1pl,https://reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/3g250w/s1pl/ctu7xu5,"The FTC regulations for sponsored content state that sponsored videos must have a disclosure in the video itself:
&gt;**If I upload a video to YouTube and that video requires a disclosure, can I just put the disclosure in the description that I upload together with the video?**
No, because it’s easy for consumers to miss disclosures in the video description. Many people might watch the video without even seeing the description page, and those who do might not read the disclosure. The disclosure has the most chance of being effective if it is made clearly and prominently in the video itself. That’s not to say that you couldn’t have disclosures in both the video and the description.  

RT has done a very poor job of notifying viewers of their sponsored content (aside from podcasts), even though they seem well aware of the rules (Michael mentions them in the [latest grab bag video](https://youtu.be/1bh1v59DV-c?t=4m) at 4 minutes).   

Maybe you think that this does not qualify as sponsored content, but the FTC states that ""Even an incentive with no financial value might affect the credibility of an endorsement and would need to be disclosed."" AH would never have played this game if it was not sponsored, and so even being given the game for free would count and need to be properly disclosed. Plus the fact that the company flew 6 of them to Germany, provided in-game items which have a real-world value, and probably paid them a bunch of money.  

I have seen people complain about this for years and nothing has changed, so today I finally reported them to the FTC. It was quite easy and you do not need to provide any personal information if you do not want to. So if you are also sick of them not properly disclosing their sponsorships, [file a complaint](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/) and maybe something will change.

They handled this channel switch like a child handling their dick for the first time. It bearly got mentioned, it just sort of happened and they expected the subscribers to come flooding in. And they're surprised they didn't reach the goal?

I know they don't like to spam us with announcements, but when it's a new channel launch you'd think that'd be the perfect reason. You cant rely on incentives and word of mouth to do this sort of thing.

Now not only have you missed your top goal by miles, but left the fans disappointed. I, for one, was really looking forward to DnD and the twenty four hour stream and now it seems we won't be getting it. Gotta admit, I'm a tiny bit bitter about it. 

Overall, you guys thought this was the best way to handle the switch, and I understand that, but it didn't work. It's obvious it didn't. Next time something like this happens, you should try some more cross promotion from your other channels, push it more and don't use incentives, all that happens is that you don't get to a certain goal and people (like me) get disappointed. Incentives work IN live streams, not FOR.

You guys are awesome, but learn from this and become even more awesome

TL;DR: I'm really pissed I'm not getting to see DnD."

I've lost a few MMO's i used to play off their site because they just kept bringing in shinier and shinier stuff. RIP English Mirror DOMO and DWO."

Also they're so awful at video games and it's not even in the funny way, it's just the somewhat frustrating &quot;not paying attention to the game and having no clue what to do even though the game tells you&quot; way.<br />There are so many other channels that put out less videos and they're shorter, but they make sure they're all good videos and cut out as much boring stuff as they can. These post long Let's Plays and people who have a ton of free time might think that's great, but the issue with that is 1) If you don't have free time, it's hard to watch it 2) Longer videos usually get boring for the most part with only a few really funny moments.<br />This ended up being longer than I wanted, but I just wanted to say that I never expected them to get to the 24-hour livestream goal because there aren't enough people who like these guys enough to subscribe because they generally aren't the most enjoyable gaming channel on Youtube.﻿"

Secondly, it isn't called a nature preserve. It's called a game reserve. Killing Cecil on the reserve wouldn't have been legal anyway because he was part of a study and had a tracker on him. They lured him away from the pride which was legal, but they killed him outside of the reserve which was illegal. Had they killed a lion other than Cecil on the reserve, everything would have been okay. The problem came when they killed a famous, protected lion outside of the territory that they were allowed to hunt in. I am against big game hunting too but don't make the story sound like what you want it to. Say the facts.﻿"

He went through all the permits and did what dozens of others did. He wasn't informed he'd be killing that particular lion, for which the guy who organizes these trips should be held responsible (though from reading up on it, killing a lion with a collar, if all proper permits are there, is still legal).<br /><br />Big game hunting is despicable, the guy's obviously a douche that needs to inflate his ego through the killing of others, but raining down hate on this one consumer is not the way to stop that from happening - but it's not about actually stopping the killing or the industry, is it?<br /><br />People don't care about that. People need something to hate so they can feel better about themselves with their rightful indignation, even though they're probably consuming dozens of animals every year. This just happened to fit the bill, because the animal in question is popular and threatened (though not from this kind of hunting). If you care so much about the fucking lion, how about donating some cash to stop poaching. Or try to support Zimbabwe, donate so the population, half of which is in food aid, can stop relying on the &quot;white man's sport&quot;.But nah, that would require more than throwing hate at a random douche.﻿"

However, the give different things. The ax gives lots of hide and a little meat, while pickax works vice-versa. This works similarly with trees (ax gives wood and a little thatch, and pickax gives thatch and a little wood)<br />Secondly, the narcoberries are used to tame dinosaurs. combine them with rotten meat and you get narcotics. Apply the narcotics to arrows to make tranquilizer arrows.(just shoot dinos with enough tranq. arrows and the will go unconscious) then you need to feed the dinos food. (if it is a herbivore, feed it berries, if it is a carnivore feed it RAW meat.) Keep in mind that this game is VERY grind heavy, and taming the right dinosaur for the right job can speed up the game INCREDIBLY.﻿"

Here's a couple basic game mechanics to make your ARK experience better.<br />Punching stuff makes you lose health. Punching also gives you less resources. If you have tools, do not punch.<br />Spears are stackable, so I like to carry 3 or 4 at a time, just in case one breaks while I'm fighting a turtle or something.<br />The Axe is better at harvesting hide from animals, and the pickaxe is better at harvesting meat. The spear is bad at both.<br />Sleeping bags are only good for one respawn, but you do need its engram to craft a Simple Bed, which makes a permanent respawn point.<br />Narcotics can be used as a better version of narcoberries for taming dinos. Or you can craft Tranq arrows a little bit after you get the bow and arrow engrams.﻿"

LetsPlay,"Let's Play - ARK: Survival Evolved: Building Home Base",youtube,roribeedm,https://plus.google.com/102076116604579621704,"For anyone who hasn't tried this game, it's a lot of fun. Public PVP servers are basically a gank-fest that you can't do much in unless you are part of a large tribe, Public PVE servers seem to have a lot of people building random foundations to mess up other players. The best way to play in my opinion is on a private server with a bunch of friends, that way you can control the settings, decrease taming times if you so choose (Can take 10 hours to tame a high level dino), you don't have to worry about random players messing up your stuff, and you can turn the server off when your group is done playing so your dinos don't starve or get killed by spawns while you're offline.<br /><br />A few tips for new players:<br />1) Different tools gather different resources more effectively. Picks gather more thatch from trees and more flint from rocks while axes gather more wood from trees and more stone from rocks.<br />2) Narcotics are more effective than the 5 narcoberries they cost to craft and reduce the taming effectiveness less on dinosaurs. Specifically Narcotics boost torpor by 40 points while narcoberries only boost by 7.5.<br />3) When you knock out a dinosaur and start taming it its taming effectiveness is set and a + level is listed. This + level is how many levels it will increase when the taming is completed, but it will decrease as the taming effectiveness goes down. The more you force feed a dinosaur while taming it the lower the taming effectiveness goes which is why narcotics are better to use.<br />4) Don't waste time building a thatch base, you learn wooden base components very early on and it's better to save your materials for that.<br />5) Craft a lot of tools, spears, and clothing early on. This is a great way to level quickly so you can learn the wooden base components as quickly as possible.<br />6) Do not waste your time or materials making sleeping bags. You can learn the Simple Bed shortly after you learn the sleeping bag and it is a permanent spawn point as opposed to the sleeping bag's single use.<br /><br />Most importantly, remember this is an early access game. It is still very early in development, basically pre-alpha, a lot will change, and there are a lot of bugs. The game also isn't optimized very well currently so even on an 8 core 4ghz system with a high end graphics card and 16 gigs of memory you are going to get lag spikes and wierd things happening. The advantage is, we get to test the game and help the developers design it. A lot of player requests and suggestions have been added, a lot of bugs and exploits have been found and fixed, and the devs are working to make the game the community wants.﻿"

If anything, they're my favorite channels and my dream job is to work alongside them.<br /><br />Honestly, i have no problem with companies &quot;selling out&quot;. Its just another way that companies make money and I've accepted that. But when it's done for a game that is so painfully generic and out of the normal range of content that the channel/company offers, it does seem like a cash grab. Seriously, EoS is SO generic, I probably couldn't tell it apart from Vindictus, or Archeage. And seeing the developers hype it up so much and talking about how much their game is different, and good, it's just cringe worthy.  And i could write a whole other comment about how Aeria Games is probably the <b>worst</b> and I repeat <b>WORST</b> company to support. Anyone that has even remotely followed MMO News knows <b>exactly</b> why that is. And other channels have done this too, like TheRPGMInx, who did a video on EoS, and it's obvious from the start that it's forced, and it's so far from what she traditionally produces, that it's obvious that it's not something she would do on her own.<br /><br />Just to clarify <b>(again)</b> because I know some fanboys will tear out my anus for disagreeing with them.

I feel like we're starting to see a lot more content that has like &quot;lower standards&quot; or whatever as far as not needing to meet the production quality of their big let's plays. Now they have this space on YouTube where they can upload things that they normally wouldn't because they didn't want to alienate the younger Lets Play audience due to some of them not being able to understand different levels and styles of humor that aren't as straight forward as Minecraft. This is a good thing and I'm super glad they did it haha I fell off of the Lets Play channel a while ago (still a sponsor on RT) but this is definitely the channel I've been waiting for.

I knew the video would either be him on his phone or him getting drunk before even clicking. Seems like the drinkings getting him down and just making him think anything he doesn't already like is stupid (like every time they play a new game. nothing to do with this video obvs its a... joke I guess is the word... even if its not funny)"
